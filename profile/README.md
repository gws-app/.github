## Background
Our team aims to develop a mood tracker application equipped with AI-driven recommendations and a chatbot feature. 
This application is designed to help users better understand their emotional well-being based on their mood history and daily activity data.
<br/>
<br/>
By doing so, it is hoped that users will be motivated to engage more actively in self-care practices, the project has progressed according to the initial plan and is now approaching completion, with the core functionalities successfully implemented. 
To enhance the applicationâ€™s practicality and align with user feedback, the emotional analysis feature was replaced with activity analysis, which provides more logical and actionable insights for users.
